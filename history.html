                     <h5>History of Coffee: Where Did Coffee Originate and How Was It Discovered?</h5>
                     <p>The history of coffee is a fascinating story. The bean has traveled the globe for centuries, being smuggled out of strict countries, stolen from royalty and has changed entire nations and economies. It’s remarkable how one small bean taken from tiny trees in Ethiopia could become the 2nd largest commodity traded in the world today.

                        Ever wondered where coffee came from, were this little bean got its start? Get ready to be taken on a journey through time and across continents.</p>

                    <h5>Where Did Coffee Originate?</h5>
                    <p>Where did coffee originate?  Well, that’s the easy bit. At the very beginning, it came from Ethiopia. But how the bean made it to every corner of the globe? That’s what we are going to dig into.

                        After a slow discovery in Africa, coffee went west into Europe to be discovered and coveted by the newer civilizations as well as east into Asia where it was planted and harvested.

                    <h5>How Was Coffee Discovered? – Ethiopia And The Dancing Goats</h5>
                    <p>The most popular origin story of the beloved bean starts with Kaldi and his goats (1) in 700 AD. Kaldi, an Ethiopian (formerly Abyssinia) goat herder stumbled on his goats acting quite strange.

                        They were dancing. This definitely wasn’t normal. He discovered that they were eating red berries and concluded that this fruit was the cause of this odd behavior.
                        
                        After stumbling upon this magic fruit, he shared his findings with a monk, who was ecstatic to find something that would help him stay awake all night as he prayed.Another story, however, claims that Kaldi shared these beans with a monk who disapproved of their use and threw them into the fire.

                        The result was a wonderful, pleasing aroma which became the world’s first roasted coffee. Shortly after this, the beans were ground and boiled to produce what we know today as coffee.</p>

                    <h5>Across The Waters – Onto The Middle East</h5>
                    <p>Though the story of Kaldi cannot be proven to be true, one thing is certain: coffee came from Ethiopia. Another thing we know for sure is where it went next. Coffee made its way north, across the red sea into Yemen in the 15th Century. The port at which the beans first arrived was called Mocha.

                        Due to coffee’s growing popularity and the shipment of coffee from the port city, Mocha became synonymous with coffee.
                        
                        So any time you hear the term “mocha,” when talking about coffee, you now know where that term originated. Coffee was grown in Yemen and became well known in Egypt, Persia and Turkey.

                        It was known as the “wine of Araby.” The beverage started to become a little too popular as coffee houses started to open up all around Arabia. These coffee houses were known as “Schools of the Wise” (2).
                        
                        These were the places you went to share and hear information. They became the epicenter of social activity. However, in the early 1500’s, the court at Mecca declared coffee to be forbidden due to its stimulating effect. A similar thing happened in both Cairo, Egypt and in Ethiopia.

                        All of these bans were eventually lifted, but coffee faced it’s fair share of persecution before that.
                        
                        Riots broke out in the Arab streets until justice was returned to the coffee drinking people.</p>

                    <h5>Into Europe And Asia</h5>
                    <p>The course of history changes when the coffee bean spreads both east and west: East into India and Indonesia and West into Italy and onto the rest of Europe.Asia’s Place In Coffee History Arabia was the gatekeeper for coffee.

                        If a country wanted coffee beans, they purchased it from Yemen. The authorities liked it that way and did everything to ensure that nobody could take fertile beans out of their control and plant the trees themselves.
                        
                        Alas, along comes Baba Budan, a Sufi saint from India who was on a pilgrimage to Mecca in 1670.
                        
                        Upon his return, Baba Budan smuggled some fertile beans back to India where he began coffee cultivation. These beans began a large scale coffee farming in Southern India which are still producing plants today.

                        In the late 1600’s, the Dutch finally started growing coffee.
                        
                        Decades earlier, the Dutch had smuggled coffee plants from Yemen in an attempt to grow the beans in Holland, but due to the cold weather their cultivation scheme failed miserably. This time however, friends in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) sent coffee seedlings to the Dutch Governor of Java, Indonesia.

                        While  multiple natural disasters wiped out their first attempts at coffee cultivation, in 1704 more seedlings were planted and coffee from Indonesia became a staple.
                        
                        Java becomes another household term for coffee.
                        
                        Eventually the coffee plant made its way to both Sumatra and Celebes, drastically increasing Indonesia’s coffee-growing capacity.</p>

                    <h5>Into The West – Coffee Invades Europe</h5>
                    <p>Coffee finally arrived in Venice in 1570 and quickly became quite popular. In 1615, Pope Clement VIII decided that the drink must be satanic.

                        Upon inspection, however, he gave in to the glory of the beverage, baptized it and declared it a Christian beverage. As the 1600’s rolled on, coffee houses sprung up all over Europe in England, Austria, France, Germany and Holland.

                        Much like the coffee houses of Arabia, these places became social hubs where one could engage in stimulating conversation and political debates. In England, these became known as penny universities.
                        
                        For the price of a cup of coffee you could learn all sorts of things as public conversations carried on. Many of these coffee houses even grew into businesses, such as Edward Lloyd’s Coffee House which became a large scale insurance company.
                        
                        In Oxford, England’s first coffee club opened. This shop would later be known as the Oxford Coffee Club where ideas and innovation were born and shared. The Oxford Coffee Club eventually grew to become The Royal Society (3).
                        
                        Coffee houses became the go-to place for English men.If they weren’t working or at the pub, they were at the coffee houses. Women at the time were furious as their husbands were never home anymore, always drinking coffee and engaging in religious and political discussions. In 1674, the Women’s Petition Against Coffee was born in an attempt to ban coffee and bring their men back home.

                        France was introduced to coffee in the 17th century – specifically in 1669 – by the Turkish Ambassador to Paris. In his time with Louis the XIV, the Royal Court swooned over the beverage and Paris was soon overtaken by the beverage.
                        
                        In 1683, after the Battle of Vienna, Austria’s first coffee house opened – The Blue Bottle.
                        
                        The Turks, who were attempting to invade the land, were shut down and left behind a surplus of coffee. The victorious officer opened the shop and popularized the practice of adding milk and sugar to coffee.</p>

                    <h5>Coffee Introduced To The Americas</h5>
                    <p>Coffee’s final frontier: the Americas.

                        Having already conquered Africa and the Indian Ocean nations and sweeping over Europe, the little beans were about to make their way even further west to conquer every nation touching the Atlantic Ocean.
                        Crossing The Atlantic
                        
                        In the early 18th century, the Dutch decided to extend their generosity in a way that would change the [coffee farming] world forever.
                        
                        The Mayor of Amsterdam gifted King Louis XIV of France a young coffee plant (4) in 1714, although the Dutch could not cultivate coffee trees in Holland, they could keep them alive in special greenhouses. This plant was protected in the Royal Botanical Gardens of Paris. A captain of the French Navy, Gabriel Mathieu de Clieu was stationed in Martinique but happened to be visiting Paris. It’s unclear whether he ended up stealing clippings from King Louie’s [secured] coffee tree or if King Louie himself gave order for de Clieu to establish a coffee plantation in Martinique.

                        Regardless, de Clieu took his clippings and set sail for the Caribbean, which happened to have the ideal coffee growing conditions. It was a long journey and de Clieu struggled to keep his plant alive.

                        Water was scarce on the boat but he managed to keep the plant alive by giving it his own supply of water and often going thirsty himself.
                        
                        Upon arriving on the island, he secretly planted it among other plants to keep it safe.
                        
                        Within 3 years coffee plantations spread throughout Martinique, St. Dominique and Guadalupe. These would be the plants that would eventually populate the rest of the Caribbean and Central and South America.
                        
                        In 1730, the English Governor of Jamaica, Sir Nicholas Lawes brought plants of coffee to his island. Within a short time, coffee was growing deep into the Blue Mountains, an exceptional growing area for coffee.</p>

                    <h5>Brazil And A Modern Coffee Empire</h5>
                    <p>Brazil grows more coffee today than any other country in the world.

                        So how did it all get started?
                        
                        With a Brazilian colonel by the name of Francisco de Melo Palheta. Francisco was sent to Guyana to settle a dispute between the Dutch and the French in 1727. His priority, however, was to get coffee and bring it back to Brazil, whatever the cost.The Brazilian colonel requested coffee seedlings from the French Governor.

                        When his request was refused, his seductive back up plan came into play. He worked his magic on the French Governor’s wife and eventually she managed to secretly give Francisco a handful of clippings.
                        
                        He took these clippings back to Brazil and started the largest coffee empire on the planet. It wasn’t until 1822 that coffee production started to boom in Brazil, and in 1852 the country became the largest producer of coffee and has remained to this day. In 1893, coffee from Brazil was taken to Kenya and Tanzania, close to the birthplace of coffee and cultivated in East Africa.</p>

                    <h5>How America Shaped The Industry Of Coffee</h5>
                    <p>America’s journey with coffee started in the 18th century with the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution. The year was 1773.

                        A group of patriots, many dressed as American Indians, snuck aboard English Tea ships sitting in the Boston harbour and dumped all of the tea into the ocean to rebel against the English tax on tea! Thus, tea became extremely unpatriotic and coffee replaced it as the American beverage of choice.

                        Ever since then, the United States has been the leading importer of coffee (5) and continues to buy far more coffee than any other country.
                        
                        This countrywide dependency on the beans has been an economic stimulus to many countries throughout South and Central America.
                        
                        Not only does America import coffee, but it actually grows a little bit of it as well.
                        
                        Hawaii (not part of America until 1959) was introduced to coffee in 1817 when coffee seedlings were brought by the Brazilians. In 1825, the first official coffee orchard was born, starting Kona’s legacy in the industry.</p>
