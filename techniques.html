                <h5>Coffee planting</h5>
                <p>A coffee bean is actually a seed. When dried, roasted and ground, itâ€™s used to brew coffee. If the seed isnâ€™t processed, it can be planted and grow into a coffee tree.

                    Coffee seeds are generally planted in large beds in shaded nurseries. The seedlings will be watered frequently and shaded from bright sunlight until they are hearty enough to be permanently planted. Planting often takes place during the wet season, so that the soil remains moist while the roots become firmly established. </p>

                <h5>Harvesting the Cherries</h5>
                <p> Depending on the variety, it will take approximately 3 to 4 years for the newly planted coffee trees to bear fruit. The fruit, called the coffee cherry, turns a bright, deep red when it is ripe and ready to be harvested.  

                    There is typically one major harvest a year. All coffee is harvested in one of two ways:
                    
                    Strip Picked: All of the cherries are stripped off of the branch at one time, either by machine or by hand.
                    
                    Selectively Picked: Only the ripe cherries are harvested, and they are picked individually by hand. Pickers rotate among the trees every eight to 10 days, choosing only the cherries which are at the peak of ripeness. Because this kind of harvest is labor intensive and more costly, it is used primarily to harvest the finer Arabica beans.
                    
                    A good picker averages approximately 100 to 200 pounds of coffee cherries a day, which will produce 20 to 40 pounds of coffee beans. Each worker's daily haul is carefully weighed, and each picker is paid on the merit of his or her work. The day's harvest is then transported to the processing plant.</p>

                <h5>Processing the Cherries</h5>
                <p> Once the coffee has been picked, processing must begin as quickly as possible to prevent fruit spoilage. Depending on location and local resources, coffee is processed in one of two ways:

                    The Dry Method is the age-old method of processing coffee, and still used in many countries where water resources are limited. The freshly picked cherries are simply spread out on huge surfaces to dry in the sun. In order to prevent the cherries from spoiling, they are raked and turned throughout the day, then covered at night or during rain to prevent them from getting wet. Depending on the weather, this process might continue for several weeks for each batch of coffee until the moisture content of the cherries drops to 11%.
                    
                    The Wet Method removes the pulp from the coffee cherry after harvesting so the bean is dried with only the parchment skin left on. First, the freshly harvested cherries are passed through a pulping machine to separate the skin and pulp from the bean.   </p>

            <div class="slideshow-item-text">
                <h5>Drying the Beans </h5>
                <p> If the beans have been processed by the wet method, the pulped and fermented beans must now be dried to approximately 11% moisture to properly prepare them for storage. 

                    These beans, still inside the parchment envelope (the endocarp), can be sun-dried by spreading them on drying tables or floors, where they are turned regularly, or they can be machine-dried in large tumblers. The dried beans are known as parchment coffee, and are warehoused in jute or sisal bags until they are readied for export.

                        <p class="card-description">Warming the cups before making a hot espresso drink helps make the coffee more appealing. Not only does it keep the drink warmer longer, but it also makes the drinking experience a more positive one. You can fill the cup with hot water before serving or use the steam wand to heat it.

                            Hot cups are particularly important when making espresso. This drink will cool quickly without a hot cup to start it off. </p>

                        <p class="card-description">Microfoam is a special type of frothed milk foam made by frothing extremely cold milk with the tip of the steam wand placed close to the surface of the milk, but still beneath it. After making the foam, the barista will then plunge the steam wand into the milk to heat it further. Microfoam not only has a smooth feel that the customer will enjoy, but it also makes better latte art.

                            To froth milk, you need to start with cold milk and a cold pitcher. Then, fill it no more than 1/3 of the way with the cold milk, because ht frothing process will increase the volume. Drain any water from the steam wand before you start.  </p>

                        <p class="card-description">Grinding coffee beans into uniform, fine particles requires a professional grinder, but this is critical to creating a tasty cup of coffee and getting the most flavor from each cup.

                            To grind well, use a professional-grade grinder. Use a medium-to-high setting, and pulse the grinder for three to five seconds at a time. Continue pulsing until you have a fine ground.</p>

                        <p class="card-description">Baristas can help by proper tamping using a firm wrist and arm. By tamping the ground coffee into the portafilter, creating a uniform density and surface, baristas can brew coffee with more flavor.

                            Start with light pressure until a puck has formed with an even surface, then dig in with some elbow grease to push it into a firm, solid puck. Use a twisting motion as you pull out from the tamp to continue forming the puck. </p>

                        <p class="card-description">Latte art is a skill that takes time to learn. When you start your job as a barista, find a latte art design that works for you, and perfect it, then, start expanding your skill. A heart is a popular choice for a first latte art piece, so consider starting there.

                            Latte art is impressive, but no one expects perfection the first time someone tries. Practice makes perfect, so give yourself the chance to learn.</p>

                        <p class="card-description"> If you feel like something is off about your grind, wait to change it until you have made at least one coffee, preferably two. This will give you enough information about what is or is not working about the grind, and allow you to correct it when you grind again.

                            By making a cup of coffee first, you will be able to pinpoint the problem and correct accurately, rather than just guessing. </p>

                            By keeping your tools close to the area where you work, you can make your coffee more efficient. Set up a coffee station that puts all of these supplies within arm's reach or less than a step or two from the main coffee machine. </p>

                            Keeping your coffee-making equipment clean every day, and often multiple times a day is vital. Even if you just make one or two shots, clean the area daily. Over time the mess will add up, and you'll have even more work in the end. Cleaning your espresso machine, for instance, needs to happen every day, and if you are a busy barista, it should happen multiple times a day. After the morning rush and before the after-work rush, give the machine a good cleaning. </p>

                        <p class="card-description">Towels are an important tool in the professional barista's back pocket, and you need to keep them organized. Have a specific towel for each particular task, like a dry towel to wipe the portafilter and a damp towel for wiping the steam wand. Never mix these up, or you will end up wiping a clean machine with a dirty towel.

                            One tip to help you keep the towels separate is to use a different color or texture for each task. This way you can quickly see which one to use when you face a busy morning with your customers. </p>

                        <p class="card-description">The hopper on your grinder should stay full at all times. Many new baristas feel surprised when the coffee speeds up or slows down when the hopper starts to empty. This occurs because the burrs in the grinder do not have an even distribution of weight.With consistent weight distribution, you will have a better grind consistency. This, in turn, means better flavor consistency.</p>
